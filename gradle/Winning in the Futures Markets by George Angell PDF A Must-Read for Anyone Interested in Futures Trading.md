If you are interested in learning the basics of futures trading, you may want to check out *Winning in the Futures Market* by George Angell. This book, first published in 1987, is a revised edition of Angell's previous work *Winning in the Commodities Market*. It covers the fundamentals, definitions, and trading strategies and rules for various futures markets, including hedging, chart trading techniques, commodity funds, managed accounts, day trading, and options on futures.
 
The book is divided into 12 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of futures trading. The first chapter introduces the concept of futures contracts and explains how they differ from stocks and bonds. The second chapter discusses the psychological factors that affect traders and how to develop a winning mindset. The third chapter covers spread trading, which involves buying and selling two related futures contracts simultaneously to profit from price differences. The fourth chapter explains how to use Gann techniques, which are based on geometric patterns and angles, to analyze market trends and cycles.

The fifth chapter explores the concept of contrary opinion trading, which involves going against the crowd and taking advantage of market extremes. The sixth chapter describes various chart trading techniques, such as trend lines, support and resistance levels, moving averages, and indicators. The seventh chapter presents the trading plan, which is a set of rules and guidelines that help traders make consistent and rational decisions. The eighth chapter deals with hedging, which is a way of reducing risk by taking offsetting positions in different markets or instruments.
 
The ninth chapter introduces commodity funds and managed accounts, which are pooled investments that trade futures contracts on behalf of investors. The tenth chapter explains the basics of day trading, which involves opening and closing positions within the same trading session. The eleventh chapter covers options on futures, which are contracts that give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a futures contract at a specified price and time. The twelfth chapter summarizes the main points of the book and offers some final advice for aspiring futures traders.
 
*Winning in the Futures Market* is a comprehensive and practical guide for anyone who wants to learn more about futures trading.
